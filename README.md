# My First Machine Learning Project

Welcome to my first machine learning project! In this project, I'll be sharing my journey as I delve into the exciting world of machine learning using Python to explore
and analyse a movie database.
## Project Overview
In this section, I'll provide an overview of the project, including its objectives and the dataset used.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To practice my acquired skills on Exploratory Data Analysis
- To gain hands-on experience with machine learning concepts and techniques.
- To build and train a machine learning model for a specific task.
- To evaluate the performance of the model and iterate on improvements.
- To improve the model and overall analysis as I continue to learn and grow

### Dataset
For this project, I'll be using [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) , which contains Multiple Features
of the most recent movies. I choose this database cause of its easy to access and understand api. 

## Project Structure
Here, I'll outline the structure of the project directory and provide a brief explanation of each component.

### Project Directory Structure
```kotlin
my_ml_project/
├── data/
│   └── movies.csv
├── notebooks/
│   └── Model_Training.ipynb
│   └── EDA.ipynb
├── models/
│   
├── utils/
│   └── TmdbHelper.py
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

### Data
This directory contains the saved data after fetching it and preprocessing it during the EDA.
The major reason for this is to avoid recurrent calls to the api which can get quite slow

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Notebook Description

The "EDA" (Exploratory Data Analysis) notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of a movie dataset, offering insights into various aspects of the movie industry. Through data visualization and analysis, this notebook delves into seasonal trends, movie popularity over time, genre preferences, movie runtimes, and the performance of production companies.

#### Key Highlights:
- **Seasonal Trends:** Discover how movie release dates correlate with holidays and seasonal changes, revealing insights into strategic timing for movie releases.
- **Popularity Over Time:** Analyze spikes in movie popularity and identify potential factors influencing audience interest.
- **Genre Preferences:** Explore the distribution of movie genres and their respective revenue performances, uncovering trends in audience preferences.
- **Movie Runtimes:** Examine the distribution of movie runtimes and identify patterns in audience preferences for movie duration.
- **Production Companies:** Investigate the top production companies based on the number of movies produced and analyze their revenue and budget dynamics.

#### Future Direction:
The notebook sets the stage for future work by laying the foundation for the development of machine learning models to predict movie revenue. By leveraging the insights gained from exploratory data analysis, stakeholders in the movie industry can make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, investment strategies, and content production.

#### Purpose:
The "EDA" notebook serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders in the movie industry, including production companies, distributors, and investors, by providing actionable insights derived from comprehensive data analysis.
#### Usage Instructions:
1. Open the EDA.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis.
3. Explore the visualizations and insights generated from the analysis.
4. Customize and adapt the analysis to suit specific research questions or business objectives.
